Summary
The logistic regression model performed exceptionally well with an accuracy score of 0.99 and a balanced accuracy of 0.9937. The precision score (customers having difficulties with payments) is 0.84, and the recall score is 0.99. These metrics indicate that the model has high precision and recall for predicting customers with payment difficulties.

Given the high accuracy, precision, and recall scores, I recommend using the logistic regression model for predicting whether bank customers will have difficulties with payments. Its performance metrics suggest that it can effectively identify customers who may encounter payment issues, allowing the bank to take proactive measures to assist such customers and mitigate potential risks.

The high precision score indicates that when the model predicts that a customer will have payment difficulties, it is highly likely to be correct. Similarly, the high recall score indicates that the model effectively captures the majority of customers who actually have payment difficulties.

Therefore, based on its strong performance, the logistic regression model is recommended for use by the company in predicting payment difficulties among bank customers.
